Hello!

My name is **Mike**, also known as [@hellomikesec][twitter-url]. You have come to the place where you will find some notes of my learning from working in DFIR and my personal projects.

Before my professional career, I studied **Information Systems** in university. Those years in school gave me the opportunity to learn about cloud computing, cybersecurity and how to build cool web applications.

Now I work **full-time** in Digital Forensics and Incident Response. When I'm not busy with work, I find time to learn new skills and challenge myself to take [certifications][certifications-url].

I will do my best to maintain this blog from time to time. If this blog has helped you, please interact and leave a comment in any of the [posts][posts-url].
