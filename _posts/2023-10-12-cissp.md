## Summary
- Passed the exam at question 175, used about 2hr 20mins
- Relied heavily on (ISC)2 CISSP OSG, Thor Pedersen's Lecture Notes and Destination CISSP Study Guide

## Study Materials
- **(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide**: The most important learning resource regarding the CISSP Exam. 
- **(ISC)2 CISSP Official Practice Test**: Questions are not like the ones you see in the exam but doing these questions help to test your knowledge on the concepts from each domain.
- **CISSP Exam Cram Full Course (All 8 Domains) by Pete Zerger (Inside Cloud and Security)**: Used it to to recap stuff that I already know
- **CISSP Certification: CISSP Domain Boot Camps by Thor Pedersen**: Used it for topics that I'm unfamiliar with or need someone to explain certain concepts in detail 
- **Destination CISSP Study Guide**: Good alternative to the OSG (it's not a replacement)
- **How to think like a CEO by Destination CISSP**: Easy to follow along and understand what a typical 'manager' would do in a given scenario
- **How to Think like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**: The first few questions threw me off but I think it's good exposure when you're preparing to take the CISSP exam.
- **Why you will pass the CISSP by Kelly Handerhan**: Useful

## Preparation

I started preparing for the CISSP 3-4 months before my exam. The first thing I did was to scan through the **CISSP Official Study Guide**. I used ChatGPT to summarise each topic into Joplin (Notetaking App) so that I can read/learn from my iPhone/iPad when I'm not with my laptop. 

If you're taking the CISSP exam, you might have some background in cybersecurity. It's important to find out what topics are tested for the exam and identify the topics you're weaker in. For me, I had some experience from university and at that point when I took the CISSP exam, I had already work for a year in DFIR. Topics regarding the CIA triad, encryption, digital signatures, digital forensics, incident response and software development life cycle were abit more familiar to me.

Going through the Official Study Guide helped me to identify topics that I was weak in. **If the summarised version in Joplin is not clear, I'll refer to the Official Study Guide or watch Thor Pedersen's lectures on Udemy**. Thor Pedersen's video is useful if you need someone to explain a topic to you in detail. **For topics that I am more familiar with, I find the CISSP Exam Cram Full Course YouTube Video by Pete Zerger was good enough**.

I tried to complete all the available questions on the **OSG** and **Official Practice Test** on the **Wiley Efficient Learning** website. It was the best way to practice and test whether I had a good understanding on the topics. It helped me to identify details that I am unsure of.

**1 Week Before Exam:** <br>
I started reading **Destination CISSP Study Guide** one week before the exam. I wished I had used this guide earlier. I will recommend it as an alternative to the Official Study Guide. Think of it as listening to another lecturer explaining the concepts in each of the domain in a different way to you. It also highlighted what you should remember for the CISSP exam. The graphics and tables in the Destination CISSP Study Guide are good visual aids that shows contrast when comparing solutions.

**48 Hours Before Exam:**<br>
At this point, I started reading **How to Think like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**. I remember going through the book and doubting my preparation for the exam because I have not done any practice questions like the ones in the book before. I did about 10 questions on this book and decided to do just relax since it was so close to the exam. I watched **How to think like a CEO by Destination CISSP** and **Why you will pass the CISSP by Kelly Handerhan** as well. 

## Exam

I booked my exam at 10.15am on 11 October 2023. I had a light breakfast with coffee because it was early. I'll was just listening to podcast that is not related to cybersecurity on the way to the exam venue. Once I registered for the exam, I waited for about 10 minutes before entering the exam hall. The examiner called me and I entered the exam hall with my jacket. 

<br>**I did all 175 questions for the exam** with roughly about 100 minutes left. The exam questions were nothing like the ones I've seen before in the practice test. It is true when others said that most of the answers to the question sounds correct. I think watching **How to think like a CEO by Destination CISSP** and reading abit of **How to Think like a Manager by Luke Ahmed** gave me an idea on what options are more favourable as a **manager** and it helped me to narrow down my choices during the exam.

At the end of the exam, I walked out thinking that I might fail because I had to do all 175 questions. I went to the printer to collect my result slip and it says '**Congratulations...**'. 

Overall, I am relieved that I managed to passed the exam after putting in all the effort for the past few months.
